After the game reveal, each member of the team independently wrote down their thoughts on what the coming seaosn will look lke, the ideas for our robot.

My first thought after seeing the reveal was “I don’t like this,” however upon further analysis of the game, I realized how well suited we were to meet this challenge, as it seems as a combination of previous engineering challenges / games that we have faced in the past. I initially realized how similar this season was to the 2021 - 2022 season, Tipping Point. This was my first season in VEX Robotics, and was similar as it includes the same goal of intaking rings onto a mobile goal. Early in the brainstorming process, we later also realized that we could incorporate an aspect from the 2022 - 2023 season, Spin Up. During Spin Up season, one goal was to cover as many tiles as possible in the game, and to face this challenge we used string launchers. We realized that we could re-utilize our string launcher mechanism, to shoot a grappling hook to the top tier of the ladder, and use a PTO [Page -] to pull our robot up. I also realized a further connection to Spin Up, particularly from a driving aspect, as the positive and negative corners are similar to the rollers, in the way that they may be guarded at the end of the match to secure points. I was also annoyed at seeing the climbing aspect again, especially since we spent a whole season working on climbing already, however we later realized it is not worth it to try to climb when you could be securing your goal in a mutator corner instead.

Last year the team was able to produce quality workmanship while rebuilding the robot for the World Championship. The team learned from past mistakes, such as poor planning and minimal peer review, to produce a more efficient work flow in which all designs were CADed on Onshape and built after confirmation from the rest of the team. However, peer review was still at a minimum and team members would often “take over” the robot, preventing others from working, thus wasting valuable time. To mitigate this, it was thought that more collaboration on design and building could be used, allowing multiple members to build more complex systems rather than just one or two and subsystems could be built and partially tuned before being attached to the robot. Also, a more rigorous peer review system in which more than one team member would review each design before construction would be very useful in preventing major design flaws.
	After watching the reveal, it was thought that allowing a robot to climb to the top of the elevation tower would be vital to success. As the field elements seemed similar to Tipping Point, a robot very similar to those of tipping point—though with a subsystem dedicated to climbing—was considered ideal. It was thought that a limiting vertical expansion limit might be put in place as a challenge, thus making climbing higher than the first or second bar unprofitable. Notable important subsystems are as follows:

- Wings to allow each robot to guard zones modifying points could be beneficial to prevent other robots from pushing past a smaller robot.
- Wedges would be necessary as controlling the location of elements would be vital to success and require an advantage in defensive driving.
- A fast drive train could also gain success since moving and collecting elements quickly could offset the dangers of being “bullied,” but a slower RPM would likely be more beneficial due to its use in defense. Note that the “fast” drive train of this season would likely be significantly slower than that of last season due to an increase in the required acceleratory power (caused by the weight of mobile goals).
- “Kaboomers” (elastic batteries using rubber bands to store energy which were used extensively in tipping point) could be incorporated to the drivetrain to reliably attain a mobile goal using their aid to acceleration.
- An intake identical or almost identical to that of Tipping Point was considered to be the most viable solution to scoring rings on a mobile or stationary goal.

Approximately an hour after the reveal, when sketching possible solutions, a mechanism using a grappling hook was considered a viable climbing mechanism. It could be launched in a similar manner to how “Spin Up” string launchers expanded and geared to the drivetrain much like the winch of our robot for the World Competition. Also, it was realized that using slanted plastic sheeting as a wedging surface and a mechanism to funnel “donuts” into an intake could reduce weight and complexity.
After the rule book was released, it was realized that a grappling hook or other climbing mechanism designed to elevate the robot above the first climbing tier was infeasible. This was due to a very limiting vertical expansion limit that would prevent any robot from expanding to the second tier or higher from the ground.
